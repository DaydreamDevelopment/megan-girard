As I am sure you are all aware, I am currently finishing up my B.Ed at the University of Ottawa. We discuss inclusiveness…. often. Being inclusive is something that is essential in the teaching industry. You MUST provide your students with tools and strategies in order to feel included in the classroom environment.

When I think of a classroom environment I often think of the following terms

# Interactive &nbsp; &nbsp;Inclusive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inviting

## Engaging &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Educational &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Essential

### &nbsp;Safe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supportive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Special

#### Unique &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Understanding &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Uncovering

We may all have various perspectives in terms of what a classroom should look like or how we should feel in a classroom however; to me, the most important is being inclusive. Below you will find a metaphor that myself and a group of colleagues came up with that best explains Inclusiveness.

&nbsp;Inclusion is like going to the doctors; first you get assessed based on your identifiable symptoms, if you are sick the doctor might prescribe you a medication to help overcome the illness. If at first the medication does not help, another method might be put in place. This can be directly related to inclusion, there might be different variants in terms of tools and resources needed by each student. Not everyone will overcome an illness on the same medication; likewise, not everyone will use the same degree of resources to be included. Just like everyone needs to attend the doctors for one reason or another; students may need tools and resources at different points throughout their education in order to be included. We don’t look down upon people who attend the doctors or take medication; and inclusion should be no different.

There is really no other way to show your students that you care about THEM about THEIR learning and about THEIR feelings then to provide them with the tools and strategies to help build these positive experiences.

Until next time,

Thanks to Mr. Parry, Ms. Hartvich and Ms. Reavie for assisting in coming up with this amazing metaphor for inclusion!
