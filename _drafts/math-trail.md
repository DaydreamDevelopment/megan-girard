It is important to provide students with the opportunity to explore the world around them. A math trek is a great way to combine real world experiences with math. Often, students do not even recognize that math surrounds them in their every day lives.&nbsp;

One of my peers and I have developed a Math Trek for a park located in Downtown Ottawa to show how easily Math can be explored in the world around us. I have attached a PDF version of our Math Trek so that you can deepen your understanding of what it truly entails.&nbsp;
