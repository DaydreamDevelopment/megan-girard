Classroom management is something that all teachers have to master in order to provide an effective learning environment for their students. Through experience, teachers begin to develop strategies and tools that they feel most appropriately reflects their class. Below you will find some of the tools and strategies that I have found work well in my different practicum experiences.&nbsp;

*Primary classroom management techniques*

Maintaining control over a large group of primary students can be challenging at times. The most important thing to consider is how you portray yourself as a teacher. Whenever I introduced myself to my students for the first time, I made sure that they knew that I was the teacher and they were the students. It is important to quickly establish a positive relationships with your students so that they respect you. Discussing appropriate classroom management techniques also ensures your students understand what is expected of them.

Volume Control: When the students in my grade 2/3 classroom were being noisy and I needed to capture their attention I would say "Oh-A" and they would respond with "A-Oh." This technique did not just magically work for my students; it was something that had to be practiced over and over.&nbsp;

Asking Questions: Beginning in kindergarten, most students are conditioned to raise their hands whenever they have something to say. Occasionally, this has to be reinforced to primary students however, with repetition it will become a natural part of the classroom.

Student Placement: How you arrange your classroom is another indicator of how students will perform. Allowing students to constantly sit beside their friends might provoke unwanted chatter therefore, it is important to strategically plan out where students will sit. Placement location is extremely important. If I had a student who constantly escaped the classroom, I would place that student furthest away from the door; therefore, preventing all attempts of the student escaping.&nbsp;

Talkative Students: In my grade 2/3 classroom, I had a couple of students who always talked out of turn and never put their hands up in order to talk. Quiet Critters, was something I introduced to my students. I had a jar of little quiet critters that these students would get as an incentive to remain quiet. The little critter did not like noise and therefore, whenever the student decided to talk out of turn the quiet critter would run away back into the soundproof jar. This really assisted in motivating my students to try their hardest to remain quiet and follow classroom rules.

*Junior classroom management techniques*

Students in the junior grades have had years of practice in terms of respecting their teacher and the classroom rules. At the beginning of the year (or whenever you begin to teach these students) I believe that it is crucial to establish classroom expectations as a class. Collaborating on classroom expectations ensures that all of your students are able to provide their input on what they deem as important expectations. Something my associate teacher did (which I REALLY liked) was having the students put their thumbprint and signature on the classroom expectations "pledge" that was hung up in the front of the class. This allows students to build a positive relationship with you from the beginning.&nbsp;

Volume Control: Believe it or not, the grade 5 and the grade 6/7 class responded really well to one of the attention grabbing phrases. In my grade 5 class I would say "ST" and the students would respond with "OP," whereas in my grade 6/7 class I would say "ready set" and the students would respond with "you bet." It is really neat to know that by grade 5/6/7 the students are accustomed to responding to these attention grabbing phrases and regardless of what is said, a response from the students is usually heard therefore informing the rest of the class to quiet down. The one problem I had with the older grades was the redundancy with the phrases. By this age, I believe that the students should be able to respond to a variety of different attention grabbing phrases. That said, when I have my own classroom one day, I will be sure to give a variety of different phrases to allow for some change in the room.

Grouping: Randomized grouping is something that I have seen&nbsp;
