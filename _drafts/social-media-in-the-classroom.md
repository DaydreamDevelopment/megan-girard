&nbsp;How can I incorporate social media into my classroom to SUPPORT student learning?&nbsp;

Technology has become a groundbreaking resource in terms of student learning. There are many positive aspects that can be reflected upon in terms of the use of technology as a tool to enhance student learning. Moving forward, social media has been introduced as a learning tool. The following three ideas showcase how social media can support student learning in the classroom.&nbsp;

*Blended Learning:&nbsp;*Through the use of technology, we are able to provide students with the opportunity to learn through a combination of social media and typical classroom teaching strategies. That said, students have the opportunity to learn at their own pace while collaborating with their peers. This can provide a confidence boost for students who struggle to collaborate through face-to-face interactions. It is important to incorporate different teaching methods to ensure the needs of all students are being met.&nbsp;

*Communication:&nbsp;*Communication with both students and parents is an essential aspect in education. Teachers can use social media as a tool to provide constant updates with parents in terms of classroom expectations, homework assignments and upcoming events. This type of communication tool could be implemented in all grades ranging throughout the elementary panel. A website is a wonderful way to keep parents informed while also updating them with pictures and descriptions on activities happening within the classroom.&nbsp;

*Student Participation:&nbsp;*Introducing social media in the classroom to elementary students opens up a new window of learning. Allowing students to participate in blog writing may promote a higher volume of student participation. Furthermore, allowing students to choose the topics they wish to write about in their blog posts could promote a deeper connection to language, creating and writing.&nbsp;

There are countless online platforms that promote student success through technology.&nbsp;Remember, social media in the classroom can have both positive and negative impacts on student learning. It is important to outline what is expected from students while using&nbsp;social media. Discussing how quickly media can be spread across the various platforms is&nbsp;essential before introducing these methods&nbsp;of technology in the classroom. Finally, monitoring student behaviour reinforces the control that a teacher has over his/her classroom in terms of how technology is used in the class.&nbsp;&nbsp;\*&nbsp;

Until next time,&nbsp;
