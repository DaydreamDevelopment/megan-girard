Using technology in the classroom is beginning to be seen as a norm. I as a teacher, see the great benefit that technology can provide towards enhancing &nbsp;student learning however...

Is there an amount of technology that is considered "too much" for our students? Is technology a distraction? Is technology enhancing all aspects of how curriculum is delivered? Can we continue to shift towards this paper-less education route and just rely on technology?

There are no concrete answers for any of the above-mentioned questions. Some days, technology will be a blessing- and some days a curse.

Something that has sparked interest surrounding digital literacy is "how can we introduce digital technology to our students so that it provides them with appropriate tools to ENHANCE their learning rather than distract them?" How do we, as educators, ensure that our students are using their technology-time appropriately?&nbsp;

Through the discussions in class today, it became evident that there is a method in which digital literacy can be introduced. The best way to describe these methods includes the formula (PST2) + (IC3)&nbsp;

(PST2)(ic3)

**Purpose:** Overarching question

**Pre-existing knowledge**: discuss what students already know about the topic they are discussing, sometimes it may be inaccurate however through discussion they will identify what is accurate and what is not

**Search**: What terms would be most appropriate to search this topic?

**Source selection:&nbsp;**How do we pick a source?

**Type:**&nbsp;What type of source do we use?

**Trustworthiness:** is everything we look at online accurate? Is the site reputable?

**Identify important information:** this will take a bulk of time in inquiry

**Compare:** You have to compare to pre-existing knowledge

**Connect:** connecting to information that has been read in other sources

**Continually Update Understanding:** continually update your knowledge and understanding of the given inquiry.

Allowing students to have time to connect their understanding to the formula promotes&nbsp;
