Hello all,&nbsp;

I just wanted to give you some insight on the purpose of my photo collections that I have added to my posts. I feel that choosing a picture that relates to my blog posts enhances the reader's experience and gives a visual representation of the message I am trying to get across. I have integrated a majority of the photos from www.unsplash.com- a useful site that provides high quality photos for free. That said, if you do not see citations under the photos that I have used, it is because I have used them from unsplash and there is no citation requirement.&nbsp;

If you need amazing, high quality photos; be sure to check out unsplash- you won't regret it!&nbsp;

Until next time,&nbsp;

Megan
