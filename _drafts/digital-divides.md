It is important to embrace the way in which we are headed as a society in terms of advancements in technology; even in the educational setting. Throughout my practicum, I have experienced the increased use of technology and just recently, the expectation of incorporating technologies into the classroom. Technology provides us with the opportunity to have research right at hand. As a teacher, it is important to remember that outside of school, not all students have access to technology (or the internet)therefore remaining patient is important.&nbsp;

So what exactly is Digital Divide?&nbsp;

Digital Divide is the gap in which students have (or do not have) access to digital technologies and the internet.&nbsp;

How can we, as teachers, minimize digital divides in the classroom?&nbsp;
