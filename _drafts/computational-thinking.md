Hello again,&nbsp;

Over time, things change. Right? We live in a fast-paced society that is constantly enhancing everything around us. Schooling is no different. Technology has and will continue to play a huge role in the education system.&nbsp;

Recently, there has been a large emphasis placed on technology in schools and bringing students up to speed on this new way of thinking like a computer scientist. Why? How will this help our students become more prepared for society? It will. Computer science is all about the theories and practices of computers. How can we get our students to think like computer scientists?&nbsp;

Computational thinking can be defined as the fundamental concepts in computer science as well as the intellectual skills needed for algorithms, patterning, abstraction and decomposition; all of which can be seen throughout the Ontario Curriculum.&nbsp;

Computer science goes much beyond this. There are three big ideas that have been addressed in the article ____________. &nbsp;Below I will provide a quick overview of these big ideas and then I will go into more detail about the foundational aspect of computational thinking and I will end with providing resources that teachers can use that reflect this idea of computational thinking and coding.

Creativity: computation is seen as a creative and innovative activity. Technology is a good resource that students can use in order to demonstrate their creativity.&nbsp;

Abstraction: abstracting key information is an incredible skill to have and is important in terms of problem solving.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Why are computational thinking and coding considered foundational literacies today?

And how do these concepts connect to media and information literacies?

How could you integrate these concepts into the work you will do in classrooms?

Resources for teachers on computational thinking and/or coding?
