Exploring with Google Cardboard was a neat way to experience the technology of virtual reality. I was able to climb up the World Trade Centre while in the comfort of my classroom. This technology provides an endless amount of opportunities for students who may not have the abilities to experience them outside of the classroom. Allowing students to use this technology as a visual means to understanding various curriculum expectations has a great benefit for both the students and the teacher.&nbsp;

Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality can be used to support and enhance student learning by providing students with opportunities to explore various elements that cannot be provided in a regular classroom setting&nbsp;

What possibilities do you see for immersive experiences in your teaching?

How could VR, AR and/or games be used to support interdisciplinary learning for primary-junior students? Why?

What would that learning look like?
