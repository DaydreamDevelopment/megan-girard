Wow, August 31st. Where on EARTH has the summer gone?

Started back at the University of Ottawa for my FINAL year of school…BUT who am I kidding? I will be in school the rest of my life.

#### How do I feel to be back?

nervous -excited -happy -sad -anxious -refreshed-curious

I know this year will be amazing. I am back with my friends, in an inviting environment, learning the final steps before beginning my dream job. I cannot believe how quickly this summer has passed by. The summer can kind of be looked at like a sparkler. At first, the sparkler looks like it will burn forever. All of a sudden. It's out. Done. Finished. The summer has disappeared. It's gone. Done. Finished.Until next year.

On Tuesday, September 6th, 2016 I will begin my final evaluated practicum. I have been placed in a grade 5/6 & 7 class in the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario. There are a whirlwind of emotions surrounding that very first day. I try to remember my previous practicum experience, reminding myself that everything will be okay. I know this practicum will be fantastic but, it is just the change and the unknown that is causing some fear.

Here is a quick overview of my summer.
<br>I traveled, I watched my best friend get married, I spent time with family and friends, I worked, I shopped, I ate, I relaxed.

I want to go into a little more detail in terms of my work this summer.

I was a supply ECE.
<br>.. but the thing is, it wasn't only at 1 daycare… I supplied at 4 different daycares. Constantly meeting new ECES, interacting with new parents and having to figure out the schedules and behaviours of a LARGE number of children. I loved it. I loved the constant change. As the summer went on, I began to realize that I have made connections with all of these amazing people. Let me tell you, going into 4 different daycares over 4 months is NOT easy. They all have so many different rules and regulations to follow. I even had to get adjusted to the most simple things like having lunch at 11:05 or 12:25.

I feel that this was the best job I could have done for the summer. I really know what it is like to be flexible, to be the "new teacher," or to be unsure of a variety of things. This is what my career will consist of for the first couple of years. I feel like I might have a foot ahead of the other teacher candidates because of the amount of flexibility that was required from me for my summer job. Do I ever want to supply at 4 different daycares again? Not really. Will I have to supply in the future? OF COURSE. I have learned so much over the summer. One thing I know for sure: I am glad I continued my education and will soon begin my career as a teacher. I have to say, working in daycare the rest of my life would not be my first choice. I love it, but man, is it ever exhausting.

Until next time
