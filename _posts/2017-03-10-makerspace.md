Technology is our future, we are all becoming quite aware of this. This semester, I am taking a Tech course that has provided me with an abundance of resources that I can use in my future classroom. I have made an outline to an assignment that I would give to my grade 6 students after completing a Novel Study. This assignment is the culminating activity therefore, all of the required knowledge will be previously taught and discussed in great detail.

# Super 6’s Maker Project: Novel Symbolism

![](/uploads/versions/img-9054---x----3264-2448x---.JPG)

This is the culminating activity for our Novel Study unit. Below you will find what is expected from you. Please refer to the rubric while completing your assignment and should you have any questions make sure to ask well in advance of the due date.

You are asked to use Inkscape to design the symbol you have chosen that best represents your feelings or opinions toward the novel you read throughout the unit. You will be shown in class how to use all of the tools you need to know in order to create this wonderful assignment.

After you have completed designing your symbol, you will save it as a .pdf and transfer it to a USB to be printed.

Next Step: As previously mentioned at the beginning of the unit, you are asked to choose a book that you don’t mind laser cutting once you have finished reading. You are going to be using your book as the basis of your assignment. You will be cutting your symbol into the book, therefore it will be unable to be read again in the future. Always remember to relate your thinking back to symbolism and the connection your symbol has to your novel.

\*\*NOTE\*\* the laser cutting is not the only requirement of this culminating activity. You must also provide a write up on why you have decided to choose your symbol and how it relates to the novel you have read.

Breakdown of Requirements:

* Read a Novel
* Think of symbolism while reading
* Relate the symbolism to your thoughts and opinions about the book
* Design your symbol in the program Inkscape
* Bring in your novel to laser cut your symbol into
* Write up the scope of why you decided to choose your symbol and how it relates to the novel/your feelings/your thoughts/your beliefs.

Below you will find a rubric and a screencast of an overview on how the Inkscape software works.
