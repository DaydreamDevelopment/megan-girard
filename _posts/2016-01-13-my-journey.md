Hello again,

Now I think it is time to explore some of the many experiences I have had throughout the past couple of years working, growing and interacting with children.

As I previously mentioned, I took up an interest in caring for children beginning at a very young age. Babysitting was just the beginning to a world of opportunities I would eventually find myself exploring.

The first time I found myself experiencing the educational field was in my first year of college. I did my initial placement in a toddler room where I learned the essential skills of planning, preparing and being flexible. The following year, I was fortunate enough to do my second placement in a junior/senior kindergarten class (before ECE's were integrated into the classroom). I had a wonderful associate teacher who guided me through the challenges of teaching the kindergarten curriculum. For my final placement of my ECE diploma I was accepted to a "specialty placement." I worked alongside a Speech Language Pathologist, Occupational Therapist and Physiotherapist at the Ottawa Children's Treatment Centre (Cornwall Division). I interacted with multiple children between the ages of 0-6 who exhibited a wide range of abilities and disabilities. On a daily basis I worked with children who were diagnosed with intellectual disabilities, autism, down syndrome and cerebral palsy to name a few. This placement was a huge eye opener and gave me quite the skills and techniques to deal with various behavioural characteristics. I am so glad I have these experiences because they are proving to already be beneficial in my bachelor of education practicum.

Following my diploma, I knew my goal of becoming a teacher was nearby. I worked for the Township of South Stormont for the summer as the Summer Events Coordinator. This was the best summer job someone in my position could have. I was required to plan the summer calendar for the children throughout my community. This really helped me experience my creative side and implementing the activities was such a blast! Some of the activities we held included: a giant superslide (water came from a fire truck!), Messy Mess Day (obstacles through food items such as ketchup, jello and cooked spaghetti noodles), Bus Trip to the Biodome, and many themed days such as Princess day, Disney Day and Under the Sea. In addition to the fantastic summer I had, this job required me to plan for an undetermined number of children (sometimes 5 would show up and sometimes over 80 would come). Additionally, there were no age requirements and therefore I had to ensure my activities were fun and adaptable for all ages. Overall it was such a great experience!

In terms of the coaching aspect, I have been a soccer coach for the Might Might division (3 year olds), and the U4, U6 and U8 divisions. I also coached T-ball for children from 5-8 years old. Last but not least, I was a Tiny-Tot/Can-Skate instructor for children just beginning to skate.

Now, to where I am today.
<br>This year I am placed in a grade 2/3 class. I absolutely love my placement, the students, the school and the staff members. Again there are a wide range abilities and disabilities and I am really learning how to make lesson plans that are inclusive of all children. Each day I finish placement I reflect on what a great opportunity it is to share my love of learning with my students, I only hope that I can have a slight impact on them to want to further their education and pursue their dreams.
