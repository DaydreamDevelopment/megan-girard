Well, here I am. Second year, second placement, second thoughts. Originally, my ideal classroom would consist of a bunch of 5 and 6-year-olds just beginning their educational journey, unsure about the schooling system, and still dependent on adults in every aspect of their lives. At least, that was what I had always pictured as my future.

Shortly after my first year of teachers college had finished, I received an email stating who my new associate teacher would be. I was quick to email her and figure out what my second practicum would look like. Well, once I got her reply, I instantly felt like shutting down, like giving up, like changing my career path altogether.

Grade 6 and 7?! Are you kidding me! I am an ECE, I am comfortable with the young children, grade 3 max, I will NEVER feel comfortable with the older students. They have attitude, they are inconsiderate, they are uncaring… at least, these were all thoughts going through my head at the time.

“Just give it a chance, its not so bad” said my associate teacher, as I expressed my deep concerns about what was ahead of me.

September 6th, 2016 I walked into my new practicum school, nervous beyond belief. Afraid of being walked all over by these “tweens.”

Phew, I had made it to lunch time without being eaten alive by these students. 2:40 came along, and THANK GOSH I was done my first day.. now only how many left until December 16th?

As I sat with my A.T after the first day, I began to reflect on everything that happened. Nothing…Nothing bad had happened at all. None of the students made me feel worthless, and none of the students made me feel powerless. I felt happy and I was excited to see what the following day would bring.

Let me tell you, by the end of the week I was having REAL life conversations with my grade 6/7 class. REAL LIFE. They gave their opinion on many different topics, and their opinion was quite valid. Those students proved to me that there is nothing to worry about. Those students welcomed me more than I had every thought possible. Those students made me realize, that they aren’t so bad. Those students made me realize that perhaps, I can actually picture myself teaching in the junior grades. Those students had totally changed my outlook. They were curious, inventive, hilarious, smart, sarcastic, caring, kind, welcoming, and independent. They were nothing like I had previously assumed. They were hilarious, they were respectful, they laughed at my jokes and not because they were funny, but because they felt the connection between themselves and me. Now, this is not to say that all grade 6/7 classes will be the same BUT at least I now know what I could possibly be up against.

So far, I am really enjoying my practicum in the grade 6/7 class. The material can be challenging at times, but I know that is what will make me a better teacher. Learning alongside my students will give me a better understanding of how to teach to my students in the most effective and beneficial way. There are so many things I want to try with these students and they are up to any sort of challenge I put in front of them.

These past couple of weeks have made me reconsider my “favourite” grade to teach, has made me REALLY think long and hard about what grade I truly have a passion for. I will let you know how I feel at the end of my practicum, but as of now… I feel like I could make myself feel comfortable in any of the grades ranging from junior kindergarten to grade 6. I am even considering getting my intermediate qualifications shortly after graduation.

Until next time
