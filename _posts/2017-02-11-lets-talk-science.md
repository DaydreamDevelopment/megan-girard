Science is a subject that might be pushed aside until students have developed their basic math and literacy skills. Science is a wonderful subject. It really is.

Science allows students to show their intelligence in a variety of different ways. Science DOES not have to be complicated. Science should be a time for fostering curiosity. Engaging students in fun and interactive activities is a good way to grab and maintain student attention. Below you will find some of the activities I was introduced to at a work shop put on by Lets Talk Science. All of these activities are fun and engaging and really allow students to learn scientific concepts in a way that they can understand. All of the materials needed for these activities can be found around the house, at the dollar store or even the local grocery store. Please remember: it is important to meet the needs of all of your students. Differentiate your lessons so all students can learn in the way that is best for them.

![Introducing the germ: The Common Cold. This little guy is a wonderful way to capture your students' attention and turn a science lesson into a fun and exciting hands on activity. All that is needed for this activity is water, 2 colours of food colouring, a dropper instrument and a cup. One student will start off with a cup of blue water (flu) and another with yellow (cold). The rest of the students each have a cup of water. The goal of this activity is to demonstrate how quickly and easily virus' and bacteria can spread. Have students walk around the classroom and when you &quot;sneeze&quot; everyone is to find someone closest to them and spread their germs. This is a great way for visual and kinaesthetic learners to really engage with their learning. Make it fun!](/uploads/versions/img-8829---x----3264-2448x---.JPG)Introducing the germ: The Common Cold.

All that is required for this activity are some items that can be found around the school. Allow students to inquire. Don't give them answers. Can you spot the simple machines in this playground?](/uploads/versions/img-8838---x----3264-2448x---.JPG)Teaching your students about simple machines?

What would happen if we put another source as the mechanism to make the car move?](/uploads/versions/img-8826---x----3264-2448x---.JPG)

Have fun with science, let your teaching passion shine through. The above activities are just SOME of the ways that you can really engage students in their learning. Remember to show your students your love of learning. Â They need to see that learning never stops. Learning is endless. Learning is fun.

Until next time,
