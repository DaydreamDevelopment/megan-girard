Become a teacher they said. You will love it they said.

What they said was indeed correct. I have only just taken the beginning steps into the world of teaching and I can already say with confidence, I am on the right track. My first practicum experience was absolutely amazing. From the moment I walked into Williamstown Public School, I knew I would make life-lasting relationships. I was welcomed into the school with open arms, all of the teachers kindly introduced themselves and the students could not have been happier to have someone new at their school.

My first day at practicum, went much as expected. I was nervous, yet anxious to see what they had in store for me. My Associate Teacher; Laurie, was awesome. She quickly gave me the rundown on how she operated her classroom and gave me some crucial information regarding the students in her class; their likes and dislikes, their academic abilities and any challenges I should be aware of. That first time hearing the bell ring was probably one of the most exciting moments. Watching as the children walked into the room staring at me as if I was some sort of foreign creature in their class. They were intrigued and excited to see what was to come of this "stranger" in their classroom.

From that day forward, I never got those glances from my students again. I was always happily greeted with tons of smiles and "good mornings." It made me feel very appreciated and welcomed. Over the course of the semester, I became really indulged in the classroom. The students all respected me as if I was their teacher and I showed them the same type of respect.

From the beginning, my associate teacher told me what a challenge our class would be. Challenge? I was up for a challenge. I did not know that almost 7 months after entering the room for the first time I would realize that what she meant by CHALLENGING was in fact, REWARDING. Yes, our students were weak, yes a majority of our students were not at grade level in terms of reading, writing or math but man oh man, was it exciting to see the progress from that first day in September when I met my students until the last day of practicum on April 8th.

One of my most memorable moments was using the PM benchmark tests to test one of my grade two students (reading). He entered the classroom not even at a junior kindergarten level (1) on the Pm benchmark. The day I tested him, he was at a level 6… I thought we would probably get him to a level 7 or 8 if we were lucky. That day, I sat with the student for over an hour, going up level after level after level. Not only did he go up to 7 or 8, he passed those levels with flying colours. By the time I was done testing him he finished at a level 17. That was a complete shock to me. His reading fluency and comprehension had increased tremendously since his first days of grade two. I have never witnessed a child SO happy and proud of himself. In fact, he was so proud that he ran over to his twin brother and told him what had happened. When his twin brother looked back at me, I shook my head "yes" and had a smile on my face from ear to ear.

I have learned that patience is the KEY to teaching. Not all lessons you have planned will go exactly as you want, not all students will understand everything you want them too, and not all students will be motivated to learn. I have decided, that is what I am here for. That is my mission as a teacher. I want to change the way students look at learning. I want them to know that ANYTHING is possible when they put their minds to it. ANYTHING. Sometimes, the outcome we desire will take a lot of extra practice and work, but eventually we will get there.

To me, the most rewarding part about being a teacher thus far (and I know it will continue to be this) is to watch the students who once struggled, understand. To watch the students who were once unmotivated, become active in the classroom. To watch the students who HATED school, smile day after day when they finally feel EXCITED to come to school.

On my very last Friday, we had a party. A party to celebrate the strong relationships we had build since that first Wednesday in September. We sat around the room, sharing in laughter and in tears. I told them this is not goodbye, I will be back. In fact, I can't wait until I can go surprise them!

I had so many opportunities at Williamstown Public School, that I cannot just write one post. Trust me, I will be back. I will continue to share my experience as I grow into the teacher I strive to be, until next time…
