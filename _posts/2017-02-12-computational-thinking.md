Hello again,

Over time, things change. Right? We live in a fast-paced society that is constantly enhancing everything around us. Schooling is no different. Technology has and will continue to play a huge role in the education system.

Recently, there has been a large emphasis placed on technology in schools and bringing students up to speed on this new way of thinking like a computer scientist. Why? How will this help our students become more prepared for society? It will. Computer science is all about the theories and practices of computers. How can we get our students to think like computer scientists?

Computational thinking can be defined as the fundamental concepts in computer science as well as the intellectual skills needed for algorithms, patterning, abstraction and decomposition; all of which can be seen throughout the Ontario Curriculum.

Computer science goes much beyond this. There are seven big ideas that have been addressed in the article . Â Below you will find a table that gives a quick overview of these big ideas. I will then go into more detail about the foundational aspect of computational thinking and I will end with providing resources that teachers can use that reflect this idea of computational thinking and coding.

This new digital age has proved to be effective in a variety of areas. Computational thinking and coding are seen as foundational literacies today because of the shift in 21st century thinking. As society continues to grow and become more advanced, it is important to shift our teaching in that direction as well. We are teaching the future. They need to know the most current and important information in order to do well once they become active members of society. As you have seen above, there are so many benefits to computational thinking that can enhance all aspects of student thinking and performance. There are links between math, science, language and media all through the use of computational thinking. As teachers, it is important for us to teach from a cross-curricular approach as often as possible; coding and computational thinking really allows for that.

There are so many new technologies that we can introduce to our students in order to gear their mindset towards computational thinking. These activities are fun and interactive; allowing our students the opportunity to really engage in their learning. There are many ways we, as teachers, can ensure that the integration of these concepts are beneficial to our classroom environment and our students, including the tremendous amount of variation it allows for. I have used www.scratch.mit.edu with my students and within the first five minutes students began rehearsing the relationships they saw between coding and other curriculum subjects. My students were engaged throughout the use of scratch and I really got to see a new side of them. The creativity was amazing. Seeing students who often struggle- succeed and seeing students help one another, really made the classroom feel like an effective learning environment. Providing my students with the opportunity to try new things, inquire, explore and have fun has brought a better sense of community into the classroom. This allowed me to see my students in a new perspective and allowed my students to really shine through in terms of their creativity and various other skills.

Remember, it is important to launch into this computational thinking with an open mind. Equally important; have a conversation with your students. Talk about the pros/cons of technology. The troubles they might run into, the importance of patience and better yet, the world of possibilities that awaits them.

Here are a list of great resources I have compiled. Remember, some of them are quite costly but be sure to check them out!

Until next time,
