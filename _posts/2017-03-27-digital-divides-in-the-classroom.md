It is important to embrace the way in which we are headed as a society in terms of advancements in technology; even in the educational setting. Throughout my practicum, I have experienced the increased use of technology and just recently, the expectation of incorporating technologies into the classroom. Technology provides us with the opportunity to have research right at hand. As a teacher, it is important to remember that outside of school, not all students have access to technology (or the internet)therefore remaining patient is important.

So what exactly is Digital Divide?

Digital Divide is the gap in which students have (or do not have) access to digital technologies and the internet.

How can we, as teachers, minimize digital divides in the classroom?

* Provide students with expectations to assignments in advance

-Ensure that students who do not have access to technology outside of school are given adequate time to work on their assignments during the school day (recess/lunch/class time etc.)

-Talk to your students, get to know what all of your students have and don't have access too. This could vary from year to year- so it is important to have this conversation at the beginning of the year.

-Send a letter home to parents, make sure that it is clear that they SHOULD NOT feel pressured to supply technology for their child.

-Do not allow students to bring in their own personal technologies to reduce the stigma towards students who do not have these materials

-Vary your assignments, make sure that not ALL assignments require use of technology. This allows students without access, the ability to complete assignments outside of the school day. Gives parents the opportunity to engage in homework with their child.

-Remember, as teachers- we are flexible and adaptable. If something is limiting your students success, change your ways.

Until next time,
