A digital story is a way of making a lasting impression on a specific topic. I along with some colleagues created a digital story that addresses the issues of diversity in the classroom. We have included some personal stories surrounding our educational experiences and we have provided some teaching strategies to ensure that all students; regardless of race, socioeconomic status, abilities or disabilities have a fair opportunity at learning in today's classrooms.

Thank you to Miss. Reavie, Miss. Hartvich, Miss A and Mr. Parry for contributing to this important topic.

Special thanks to Mr. Hudson and Miss. Aliya for being our interviewees. Children always add a special touch.
