Using technology in the classroom is beginning to be seen as a norm. I as a teacher, see the great benefit that technology can provide towards enhancing  student learning however…

Is there an amount of technology that is considered "too much" for our students? Is technology a distraction? Is technology enhancing all aspects of how curriculum is delivered? Can we continue to shift towards this paper-less educational route and just rely on technology while ensuring our students are receiving the best education possible?

There are no concrete answers for any of the above-mentioned questions. Some days, technology will be a blessing- and some days a curse.

Something that has sparked interest surrounding digital literacy is "how can we introduce digital technology to our students so that it provides them with appropriate tools to ENHANCE their learning rather than distract them?" How do we, as educators, ensure that our students are using their tech-time appropriately?

Through the discussions in class today, it became evident that there is a good method in which digital literacy can be introduced. The best way to describe this inquiry based tool includes the formula (PST2) + (IC3)

(PST2)(ic3)

**Purpose:** Overarching question (must be open-ended or that limits the basis of inquiry)

**Pre-existing knowledge**: students can discuss what they already know about the topic they are inquiring, sometimes their pre-existing knowledge may be inaccurate; however, through discussion they will identify what is accurate and what is not

**Search**: What terms would be most appropriate to search this topic?

**Source selection:**How do we pick a source?

**Type:** What type of source do we use?

**Trustworthiness:** is everything we look at online accurate? Is the site reputable?

**Identify important information:** this will take a bulk of time in inquiry

**Compare:** You have to compare to pre-existing knowledge

**Connect:** connecting to information that has been read in other sources

**Continually Update Understanding:** continually update your knowledge and understanding of the given inquiry.

Allowing students the time to connect their understanding to the formula and processes of research, prompts more strategic research.

Digital literacy really surrounds this idea of student based inquiry, but how do we promote inquiry without providing limitations?

Students may have a question they want to further inquire and due to the forward movement of technology, the resources are easily accessible. Allowing students to take their inquiry into the digital world provides endless opportunities to learning. Students might originally be inquiring on one topic and through their research, see something else that sparks their interest.

As a final note: technology has provided various advancements in assisting students who struggle producing evidence of their knowledge and understanding of various topics within the curriculum. There are now ways that lessons can be adapted to ensure all students are receiving education in the ways that best meet their needs. There are programs that have been developed to assist students with reading, writing, expressing their opinions and connecting the curriculum in ways that allow them to understand. This is a huge advancement in creating inclusive classrooms that meet the needs of all learners.

Remember, as technology continues to advance, it is important we- as teachers, keep our technology skills up to date. Therefore, we might need to continuously educate ourselves on the new and improved technology. This provides a great teachable moment for our students- as teachers, we are endless learners. As students, we are endless learners. As humans, we are endless learners.
