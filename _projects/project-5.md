Prior to the first day of school, my associate teacher had asked for a new job chart for our grade 6/7 classroom. Technology is the future and therefore this iHelp job board was the perfect addition to the tech filled grade 6/7 class. Providing students with the opportunity to hold responsibility to a task prepares them for the future. I had all of the images printed however as a class, we came up with the names for each of the "apps" students were going to be responsible for. This gave students the drive to want to participate because they had the opportunity to input their ideas and opinions. Giving the class a job chart helps organize various aspects in the classroom. Changing the jobs on a regular basis was also important so the individual who held responsibility for a job got a break. I love this idea of having jobs in the classroom because it not only helps the students, but me as the teacher as well.
