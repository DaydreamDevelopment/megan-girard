What better way to allow students to explore mathematical concepts then writing on the windows? My grade 6/7 class was comprised of a large number of boys, very active boys. Allowing students to get up, move around and work through problems while standing gives them the opportunity to express their knowledge in new ways. The grade 6's were exploring patterns in t-charts when I gave them the opportunity to try something new-vertical surfaces-best decision ever. The class quickly dispersed throughout the room and full on math conversations began to take place. The students were very focused throughout their exploration and were proud of their findings. After completing this activity, the class asked if this could be a new way of working through mathematical problems. This is such a great method to help those kinaesthetic learners achieve the required outcome in a fun and active way.
