Assessment is extremely important in the teaching world. It is expected by all of those around us that we will provide some type of mark or feedback based on a child's knowledge of a given subject. Testing students during a unit through written tests is the most common form of assessment. This can be a way of provoking anxiety in students who do not perform well under time constraints or pressure. This is not to say that as a teacher I will never assess my students through written tests however, I think it is important to give students various opportunities to show their knowledge and understanding of a given topic. Setting up students for success is one of the most important pieces of being a teacher. Differentiating the way we test our students can help meet the needs of all of our diverse learners. I decided that for the culminating activity for the grade 5 geometry unit, students would get to create their own level of Angry Birds (Angle Birds). Students were given a checklist of items they were required to include however, this was not to say they were limited to only using those items. This form of assessment allowed students to be creative while showing their understanding of the geometry concepts learned throughout the unit.

I noticed that students who normally shut down, refuse to participate or just don't do well- succeeded. Students were engaged, excited and proud throughout the completion of their assessment piece. It was such an amazing moment-as a teacher- to see how my students really appreciated a fun and unique way of assessing them. The outcome was absolutely amazing, there were no two final products that reflected upon each other. Each student's Angle Birds was unique and completed to the best of their ability.

As I continue to grow as a teacher, I will be sure to implement new ways of assessing my student's knowledge and continue to set them up for success.
