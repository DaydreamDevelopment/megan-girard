As you may have read already, I am very interested in assessing my student's knowledge and understanding of a given topic in ways that set them up for success. For the culminating activity for my grade 6/7 geometry unit, I gave them the opportunity to create a 3-D city. There were many steps completed before coming to the end result. Students began by making a 2-D blueprint of what they wanted their section of the city to look like, along with how they were going to incorporate the required elements and geometrical properties. This project allowed for creativity however it also gave students suggestions if they were unable to think of buildings or aspects to include in their section of the city. Some students partnered up with another student who had the same section and communicated who would include what so there was no repetition. The students were required to use their original blueprint to create the final product. Some changes could be made, but overall, they had to follow what they had originally planned. I was able to assess their 2-D blueprints, their creativity, their 3-D nets along with their knowledge of various geometric properties. I allowed students to discuss what they know one-on-one as they showed me their section of the city.&nbsp;

My students enjoyed the entire process of this assignment. It was interesting to see their outlook on focusing on the process of the given assessment rather than the final product. Additionally, the completed project promoted a sense of community within the school. Students from other classes were interested in seeing how the grade 6/7's tied math into a real life & hands-on experience.&nbsp;
