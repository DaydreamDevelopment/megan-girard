In September, my grade 5 class was learning about rounding. They were having a hard time grasping the concept so I decided to introduce a math game "Roll it." Students were partnered up and were given the materials they needed in order to play the game. Students were given three dice, one to represent the ones, one to represent the tens and one to represent the hundreds. Students were to roll the dice and then round their number to the nearest 10. Once they had figured that out, they were to look at their Roll It card and mark off the number they had rolled. The game was a great way strengthen their understanding in rounding. Students who were struggling asked their partners for assistance- which promoted peer teaching. Overall, this game was a great success and really helped consolidate student learning on rounding.&nbsp;
