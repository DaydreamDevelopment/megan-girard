Introducing a club at my practicum that I am really passionate about allowed &nbsp;me to connect with students outside of my regular class. On my second day of practicum, I asked the principal if it would be okay to start a board game club-and of course she was extremely excited to see this implemented into her school. Every Wednesday, students from grades 5-8 were invited to attend the board game club. I had various games for the students to choose from and occasionally they even brought their own from home. It was quite a unique experience because not only did it allow me to meet students who were not in my class, but it also gave me the opportunity to connect with students who I was teaching in a new and interesting way. The students who attended the board game club really appreciated the time that gave up so they could enjoy doing something they loved. This is something I am extremely excited to implement in my future teaching career. &nbsp;As a child, I loved attending different clubs and intramurals and therefore, will provide my future students with the same opportunities.

Clubs can really help bring community into the school. Connecting with students outside of my classroom is important to me. I want all of the students in my school to realize that I am not only the teacher of a specific class but rather, a teacher of all of the students in the school. I want to encourage students to take risks, try new things and meet new friends, what better way to do this then to implement extra-curricular activities that promote socialization and allow for new opportunities.
