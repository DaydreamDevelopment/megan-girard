Beginning a club at school that I am passionate about really helped me connect with students outside of my regular class. On my second day of practicum, I asked the principal if it would be okay to start a board game club-and of course she was extremely excited to see this implemented into her school. Every Wednesday, students from grades 5-8 were invited to attend the board game club. I had various games for the students to choose from and occasionally they even brought their own from home. It was quite a unique experience to implement a club because not only did it allow me to meet students who were not in my class but it also gave me the opportunity to connect with students who I was teaching in a new and interesting way. The students who attended the board game club really appreciated the time that gave up so they could enjoy doing something they loved. This is something I am extremely excited to implement in my future teaching career. Â As a child, I loved attending different clubs and intramurals and therefore, will provide my future students with the same opportunities.
